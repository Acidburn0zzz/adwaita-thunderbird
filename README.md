# We've moved!

We've renamed the team and moved all the Adwaita Firefox, Chrome, and
Thunderbird themes to "GNOME", as that's a more reconizable name.

(Adwaita is the internally used name for the GNOME theme.)

You can find us at our new home on github, at:
https://github.com/gnome-integration-team
